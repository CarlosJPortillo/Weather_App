# Weather_App
This is an app that integrates Google Maps API and the Wunderground Weather API to display weather conditions for a specified location. It first uses the Geolocation API to get your current location. Using that locaiton it displays a Google maps widget relative to your current location. The map has a click event listener, where it displays the daily forecast with weather/conditions, as well as the next 10 days of weather and conditions. In order to run this application, one must have both files included in the same a directory. You then open up the index.html file with your browswer of choice and the app should run. Screenshot of how should look when a click is trigged can be seen in the WeatherApp_Screenshot.JPG file
